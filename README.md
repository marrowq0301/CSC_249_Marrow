I am still relatively new in my coding journey.  I have done coding to some degree at previous jobs, but have not done coding outside of classes in years.  I want to focus on Python since I believe there is plenty of room of improvement for me.  This is especially the case since I want to pursue a Data Science career.

My favorite hobby is auto repair.  I find it to be therapeutic.  I believe the problem solving aspect is likely what I like the most about it as well as being able to compare the difference (and improvements) between old parts and new parts.  The reliability factor knowing that the new parts were installed properly is also a motivating factor.

As it relates to spectator sports, it would probably have to be football.  Mainly because football is a strategy-based sport more than anything else.  In a lot of instances, if the coaching is really good, you can find teams with less talent, but do a lot more winning versus teams that are absolutely loaded with talent.  I find this to be fascinating.  This is sometimes the case with college football as well, but definitely the case with the NFL.
